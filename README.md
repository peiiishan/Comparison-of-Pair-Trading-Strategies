# Comparison-of-Pair-Trading-Strategies
Pair Trading Strategy Models using Linear Regression and Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process.

This project aims to compare different pair trading strategies and examine how they perform under different market conditions. 
For the purpose of the project, we construct effective pair trading strategies with S&P 500 and its 11 highly traded sector ETFs. The dataset has a daily frequency and covers data from 1993-02-01 to 2022-10-21. When comparing the Kalman filter with rolling-window regression, we find the smoothing effects of the Kalman filter offer lower downside risks to investors.
